            <p><strong>Hi my name is Stephen, and I am the next Pirate King!</strong></p>
            <p> To start off I am 26 years old. I have lived all my life in Southern California in Rancho Santa Margarita. For those that don't know that is 
                is Mission Viejo pretty much. I really like what I study here even though I am really unsure of what kind of job I will be seeking after I 
                graduate this semester. Aside from studying and coding, I like to do:
                <ul>
                   <li> Everything that has a ball in it or a board to ride on. </li>
                    <li> I love music and playing guitar. </li>
                    <li> I like food.</li>
                    <li> I like making and building things which is probably why I study CS.</li>
                    <li> I like some anime...if you haven't figured my favorite anime it is the famous One Piece.</li>
                </ul>
