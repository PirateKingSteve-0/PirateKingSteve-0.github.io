        <p>Why are you in this course?</p>
        <p>I am in this course for a few reasons.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>This is an elective that worked out for my schedule</li>
            <li>I figured this could be useful if one day I decided to go into web development</li>
            <li>I have three classes left and I just want to get out of here</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Do you already have experience with web developmen?t</p>
        <p>This is definitley my first time in a class that requires we use any html/css. I did work for a snowboard shop two years ago
           doing php. I had to edit the website that was made in 2007, make it secure, and update some of the product database. It was eh.
        </p>
        <p>What are you hoping to learn?</p> 
        <p>I am hoping to gain a better understanding of html and css. Learn some javascript. Web stuff seems fun and I just want to find out why.</p>
